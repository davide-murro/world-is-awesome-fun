## Configuration

Configuration is quite simple.

- Check that all libraries are updated in NuGet Package manager for .Net Core and in wwwroot > lib for javascript
- Check and, in case, edit _appsettings.json_ file

  ```json
  {
    "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Information",
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
        "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
      }
    },
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "WorldIsAwesomeContext": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=WorldIsAwesome;Trusted_Connection=True;" // Line to edit: DB connection string
    },
    "FolderManagement": {
      "ExperiencesMedia": "Custom_ExperiencesMedia", // Name of folder where experience media are saved
      "UsersPictures": "Custom_UsersPictures", // Name of folder where user pictures are saved
      "PlacesPictures": "Custom_PlacesPictures" // Name of folder where place pictures are saved
    },
    "SMTPMail": {
      // Paragraph to edit: SMTP Mail configuration
      "Server": "mail.worldisawesome.fun",
      "Port": 25,
      "Username": "info@worldisawesome.fun",
      "Password": "",
      "IsSSL": false
    }
  }
  ```

- Check and, in case, edit _launchSettings.json_ file
  ```json
  {
    "iisSettings": {
      "windowsAuthentication": false,
      "anonymousAuthentication": true,
      "iisExpress": {
        "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:49886",
        "sslPort": 44310
      }
    },
    "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
    "profiles": {
      "IIS Express": {
        "commandName": "IISExpress",
        "launchBrowser": true,
        "launchUrl": "weatherforecast",
        "environmentVariables": {
          "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
        }
      },
      "www.worldisawesome.fun": {
        "commandName": "Project",
        "environmentVariables": {
          "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
        },
        "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000;https://localhost:5001" // Line to edit: these are urls where the application is hosted during the debug
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  - It is not necessary to use IIS Express to host the application, but kestrel webserver is enough
  - It is possible to install SSL certification to make https protocol working in development mode just executing this command:
  ```PowerShell
  dotnet dev-certs https --trust
  ```
